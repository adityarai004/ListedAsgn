Listed Assignment

## Description

This project is a solution for the assignment given by Listed, a startup company. The goal of the assignment was to develop an Android application using the MVVM architecture pattern, integrate a private API with a bearer token for data retrieval, and implement a chart to visualize the data.

The application fetches data from a private API using the provided bearer token for authentication. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase. The ViewModel interacts with the repository, which handles the data retrieval from the API. The data is then displayed in the UI using LiveData observables.

The chart in the application is implemented using the MPAndroidChart library. It visualizes the data obtained from the API in a clear and interactive manner, providing insights and trends to the user.

## Features

- Integration of a private API with bearer token authentication
- MVVM architecture pattern for clean code separation
- Use of LiveData for reactive and observable data updates
- Implementation of a chart using MPAndroidChart library
- Data visualization and analysis

## Technologies Used

- Android SDK
- Kotlin
- MVVM architecture pattern
- Retrofit for API communication
- MPAndroidChart library for chart implementation
